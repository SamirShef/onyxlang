# Onyx
**The Onyx Programming Language**

**Onyx** is a modern compiled programming language designed for those who need the **performance of C++** but lack **the security and comfort of modern tools**.

We believe that programmers should not have to choose between **“fast”** and **“safe”**. Our goal is to strike a balance between the two.

Built on LLVM.

**Simple program:**
```onyx
fun main() : i32 {
    return 0;
}
```
This program does nothing :)
